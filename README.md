          parameterization should be imposed on the matrix of factor
          loadings (if TRUE) or not. Default: TRUE.

### [February 10, 2020] Version 5.0 (not yet on CRAN). 

Now the lower triangular expansion on the matrix of loadings is optional.

### [January 21, 2020] Version 4.6 submitted to CRAN. 

In this new version I have removed all dependence on the orphaned doRNG package.

### [Jan 08, 2019] fabMix version 4.5 uploaded to CRAN

Bug fix in `plot` for `Lamba_map`.

### [December 23, 2018] fabMix version 4.5 uploaded 

Bug fix in `plot` for `Lamba_map`.

### [November 28, 2018] fabMix version 4.4 available on CRAN

Improved plot and summary methods. See [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fabMix).

### [November 21, 2018] fabMix version 4.4 edited

Improved `plot` and `summary` methods. This new version will be available to CRAN later this month.

### [November 9, 2018] fabMix version 4.4 uploaded

This version fixes a bug to output which caused the main function to crash at certain cases. Not on CRAN yet.

### [October 30, 2018] fabMix version 4.3 available on CRAN

See [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fabMix)

### [October 8, 2018] fabMix version 4.3 added (currently under development):

The `fabMix` function now features a new argument (`parallelModels`), allowing the user to run different models in parallel. This is combined with the pre-existing option to run heated chains in parallel, thus, parallelization is now implemented in __both model-level and chain-level__. 

### [October 2, 2018] fabMix version 4.2 added with Windows compatibility.

### [September 2018] Versions 3 and 4 added, which contain a plethora of new models and functionalities. 

Version 3.0 introduces new parsimonious models. 

Since version 4.0, the package is integrated with C++ code. 

Version 4.1 improves the Lambda output: all MCMC values are now exported to a single file (instead of multiple ones, as done in previous versions). 


### [March 2018] Paper accepted to [Computational Statistics & Data Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2018.03.007) (please use version 2.0 of the software for the relevant scripts)

1. Recent versions are recommended. 
2. All package versions smaller than 4.2 are compatible only with Linux distributions.

### [September 2017] Version_2.0 added with support for **missing values** :waxing_gibbous_moon:
